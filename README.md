Practicing-Data-Discovery
=========================

This work on Visualization was done using javascript library (D3.js and add-on C3.js) as I was helping one of my teacher to build a modelling tool (first version using Logistic Regression). The goal is to provide a chart visualization for variable selection to include in a model:

This second work on Visualization was done using javascript and WebGL. This is trying to solve the issue of "Bigger Data", displaying 1 million rows of GPS traces from Uber rides in D3.js is not tractable... So using the graphic card's power should improve these type of issues:

Basic Data Manipulation using Pandas library to clean and transform datasets to study a specific question: 

First, let's retrieve some data and build a simple study case on the following question: Are macroeconomics influencing car sales?

Next, we can use our favorite statistical tool to conduct Data Analysis using R and perform a Linear Regression on the produced dataset:
